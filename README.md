# To-Do-List-App-using-Java
This project is a simple **To-Do List** application built using Java and Swing for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to manage tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove finished tasks. The application is designed with a clean and intuitive layout to enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Users can add tasks to the list with a click of a button. Each task is displayed with a sequential index number.
- **Mark as Done:** Users can mark tasks as completed, changing the task's color to indicate it's done.
- **Clear Finished Tasks:** Users can remove all tasks that are marked as completed with a single button click.
- **Auto-Indexing:** Task numbers are automatically updated when tasks are added or removed.
  
## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Core language used for building the application.
- **Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: Provides event handling and layouts.
